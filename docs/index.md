flexABLE stands for “Flexibility-oriented Agent-Based Laboratory for Electricity system analysis”. flexABLE is an open-source Python-based toolbox to simulate European electricity markets focusing on the German bidding zone. The toolbox could be used to backcast electricity prices of previous years and the unit-wise power generations.
